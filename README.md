**_Feel free to add your own tips, or entire sections. Just type away._**

*Status: Draft *

*Author: borg286*

*Working on: Machines tier, and tagging tips with associated mod*

This document is targeted at both beginners and veterans of Modded Minecraft. If you've only played vanilla see the next section below. If you’re coming from 1.7.10 we have lots you’ll find familiar (decent trade), and lots that’ll will get you excited to jump back in. [Here](#heading=h.hblz2iuf0lp7) are the major changes.

This document focuses on getting good bang for the buck. I'll favor slimeslings over jetpacks due to the entry cost. I like to ask the question, but what does this let me actually do (I’m talking to you Thaumcraft). Machines that open up further machines are less of a concern for me.

I also happen to be playing All the Mods, so if you find a tip that I haven't tagged with the mod it comes from, sorry. This document is trying to work well for most mod packs.

### How do I get into Modded Minecraft?

Historically, in modded Minecraft, installing mods used to be difficult and just for the tech savvy. But we're in 2018, and modded Minecraft is big enough for easy solutions to exist. These solutions are called "Modpack Launchers", and they’re basically alternate applications (which substitute or wrap around the Official Minecraft Launcher) that allow you to install and launch modpacks without having to mess with the files yourself (although, if you’re used to modding on other games or just very tech savvy, you could very well mess with the files yourself to customize your experience, as none of these launchers stop you. But we’re not focusing on that here).

* [Windows/Mac](https://app.twitch.tv/download): The Twitch App should recognize your Minecraft install and offer you a Mods tab. Browse for [FTB Revelations](https://www.feed-the-beast.com/projects/ftb-revelation), [All the Mods 3](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/all-the-mods-3), or other modpacks. Click Install and play.

* [GNU/Linux](https://multimc.org/#Download) (Or Windows and Mac if you prefer a less guided and more manual approach to your modding experience): Download the modpack files from Curse and create an instance in MultiMC, selecting the Modpack from your files.

# Early Game

## Punching Trees

Starting off you'll punch trees and make vanilla tools like normal. Most modpacks add in lots of flora and tree types, which can clog up your inventory unless you’re focused. Here are some tips to help keep your inventory and goal focused.

* Flower basket [Biomes O' Plenty]: Free up inventory from most plantable things

* Stone AIOT[Actually Additions]: craft a Stone pickaxe, Sword, Hoe, Shovel, Axe and then craft them all together

* Stone sickle[Extra Utilities 2]: Clear 5x5 of plants

* Stone Hoe clears 3x3[Quark] and can till dirt which might spit out worms[Actually Additions] for hydrating/growing a farm

* Crafting table on a stick[Actually Additions]: craft a sign and crafting table to make a poor man's wireless crafting terminal

* What to hunt down:

    * Cobble, Wood, 

    * Clay, gravel, sand (2 stacks each) for Tinkers Construct later

        * Rivers are the best place to hunt these.

    * Rubber wood[IndustrialCraft 2]: You only need a couple blocks

    * String from flax[Actually Additions] found in forests

    * Rice[Actually Additions] is found near rivers

    * Animal meat: Tinkers Construct lets you turn it into Leather; useful for backpacks.

* Search high in mountains for Amaranth[Astral Sorcery](drops glowstone)

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_0.png)![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_1.png)![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_2.png)![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_3.png)

## Your first hovel

### 9x9

Alternatively carve out a 9x9x6 tall room, with torches centered on each wall should be room enough to get you through to end game.

Consider making a Mob Filter(player) to replace your front door.

### [MineColonies] Supplyboat

### ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_4.png)

If you have [MineColonies] craft 5x boats -> Supply Boat (see image)

1. Apply to shore to get your first base

2. Build a dock with steps for easy access

### Sleep

If after crafting your first bed you still have some wool then craft a Sleep charm[Dark Utilities] from a second bed, open inventory, click on circle to open baubles. Pop the charm in. Now sleep is instant.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_5.png)

Sleeping Mat[Cyclic]: Portable bed which can toggle if you reset your spawn point

### Waypoints and Teleportation

[Journey Map] (That map in the upper right) lets you set waypoints that are visible from anywhere so you never get lost.

1. Move to a place you want to remember

2. Hit 'j' to open the Journey Map UI. Click the diamond at the bottom. Click ‘New’ and give your current location a name and save it.

3. If cheats are enabled you can click 'teleport' on any waypoint

Teleport home[?]

1. Stand on a block higher than the normal ground floor. Destroy the block afterwards.

2. Open the console with /

3. /sethome

4. This will set your current position as home. Next time you run '/home' then you will be teleported back to that spot. Sometimes a half block lower, which is why you got higher when you set it.

### Early Automation

CraftFurnace[Terraqueous]

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_6.png)

This furnace has 6 slots for each of its inputs and outputs and cooks 2 items at a time. It also has 3 slots for fuel. It also keeps its place when fuel or items runs out, so no wasted fuel nor ores that waste fuel that almost was enough.

1. Make a furnace as usual

2. Smelt 8 cobble into stone, and upgrade to the CraftFurnace

3. Craft all the Grout(gravel, sand, clay) for a Tinker's Construct Smeltery later (doubles ore, makes alloys)

4. Cook all your meat, wood and sand. 

5. Chunkloading

    1. Open the inventory and click on the friends button in the upper left. Shift click, then shift right click on chunks you want to always be running instead of freezing in time when you go away. This keeps machines working, and entities from despawning. F3+g shows chunk boundaries.

### Gardening

1. Place your worms[Actually Additions] on flat ground. They till grass, water, and periodically bone meal a 3x3.

2. Plant wheat for food

3. Plant your Rice. Rice can be turned into rice seeds if you want to invest in the future rather than use the rice now. Note that some modpacks removed sugarcane-> paper recipe, with rice being the replacement.

*Ability: Gaining fast travel and Removing falling damage*

1. Craft Rice[Actually Additions] into Rice Dough, Craft 4 with a bucket of water to get Rice Ball

2. 9 rice balls -> Slime cube -> Green slime balls -> Slime block

3. 2  slime blocks + 2 slime balls = Slime boots

4. 3 slime balls + 2 string + 1  slime block = Slimesling![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_7.png)

5. Take 20 Rice Dough before heading out to mine iron

Watering can[Extra Utilities 2]![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_8.png) Right click on water to fill up, Right click on crops to water 3x3, albeit slowly

See [optional Magical Crops quest](#heading=h.u6dar7pz86o1) if you're into farming.

### Leather and Food

Drying rack[Tinker's Construct] is made from vanilla wood (acatia, oak, spruce…) are placed on walls for drying out meats.

By now your meat should be all cooked. To get leather hang cooked meat on the rack and wait

* Cooked meat -> Leather

* Zombie meat -> jerky (eat this instead)

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_9.png)

## More inventory and flight

### Home Inventory

#### Poor Man's ME system

Storage crate[Actually Additions]: The small version has as much as 4 chests and doesn't need open air above it.

Crafting station[Tinker's Construct]: This has access to the inventory of an adjacent inventory like the above crate

#### [Jei]

* This is like the crafting guide in a vanilla Crafting Bench, only better

* Just Enough Items is the right pane of items when you open a crafting table or your inventory.

* Use the search field to find items, clicking on them opens their recipes.

* If your inventory, or when using a Crafting Station, the attached inventory JEI sees if you have everything you need and either makes a dark '+' button (hovering over it highlights missing items), or a light ‘+’ button. Clicking it pulls all needed items into the crafting grid.

* For the advanced user you can use [regular expressions.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regular_expression)

* Click anywhere to take focus off the search field, then Hover your mouse over a searched item and press 't'. This makes that item smoke in nearby chests. If it doesn’t check the controls for the right key binding.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_10.png)

* Opening a vanilla chest you can search for items to highlight them [Quark]. Sadly other chests (crates,...) won't get this. See Poor man’s ME system below if you want to go this route

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_11.png)

#### Personal Inventory

* Click the Merge button[Quark] to drop off any matching items

* Click the Export to drop off everything not in hotbar

* Click the Re-stock button[Quark] to top up on matching items

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_12.png)![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_13.png)

* [Quark] also adds a button to your personal inventory to drop off all non-hot-bar items. Holding sneak turns this into a merge function so chests that have at least 1 of that item can vacuum it from your inventory. Easy way to drop your stuff off when get home from a mining trip.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_14.png)

* Empty sack of holding[Cyclic] can pick up chests and **crates** w/o weighing you down like dollies did. This makes mining trips super productive. No longer do you need to manage your personal inventory.

* Leather Backpack[Iron Backpacks]: Seems like equipping the backpack is often disabled, but can be right clicked to give you 2 more rows of inventory slots. Iron, Gold, and Diamond progressively upgrades them.

* Digger's Backpack[Forestry] passively holds Cobble, Dirt, Gravel, netherrack, Sand[stone], Clay, Flint

* Flower Basket[Biome's a Plenty] holds most seeds and saplings

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_15.png)

* [Cyclic] lets you permanently add a crafting table and large chest's worth of inventory slots by eating special food. Search for "Inventory Crafting Table" and “Inventory Upgrade” for the recipe. The most expensive items are Ender chest for the inventory upgrade, and a diamond and emerald for both upgrades.

#### Falling With Style: Elytra but different

* Glider[OpenBlocks] ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_16.png)(12 leather)

* Right click to equip and jump off a ledge to glide. Sneak to go faster.

* Unlike the Elytra, you need to keep it selected, and you can't pull up

* Later you'll get a slimesling[Tinkers]![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_17.png) to get altitude; no need for fireworks

### [Optional] Magical Crops

* Description of how magical crops works in 1.12 and what it can do

    * Entry with shards

    * Finite core

    * Master core

* Greenhouse glass[Actually Additions]

* Sprinkler[Cyclic]

* Fertile soil[Rustic]

* Worms[Actually Additions]

* Fertilizer[Industrial Foregoing]

## Tinkers Construct

* Start by crafting 20 Blank Patterns

    * These are used to craft the tool benches and parts we need.

    * Search up Stencil Table, Pattern Chest, Part Builder, Part Chest, Tool Station in Jei and assemble them like below. Adding a Crafting station to the mix gives you access to all of them in one UI. The Stencil table must touch the Pattern chest for access, and so forth in the order above.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_18.png)

Open any of these and start with the Stencil Table to make patterns. Store those in the pattern chest, Use the pattern to make parts. Use the Tool Station to assemble those parts into a tool. The tool station shows you what parts are needed for each tool. You can replace your parts later on, so know that your choice of material isn't going to kill your future.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_19.png)![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_20.png)![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_21.png)

* Flint pickaxe with a bone handle, Wooden short bow with flint heads on the arrows

    * If going for Obsidian AIOT then don't worry about the other tools for now.

* Sharpening Kits are useful for restoring damage on the run. Whatever material you craft for your head, consider if you have enough for a kit, it costs 2 units of the base material. A cheaper alternative is to take a Tool Station with you in your backpack. This approach doesn't work well in the heat of battle.

* Most modpacks have Tinkers Leveling, which adds modifier slots the more you use your tool. Read up on "materials and you" for more info on these awesome slots.

### Tool Forge

The Tool Forge opens advanced tools and requires 4 iron blocks, sometimes it is any metal; just check JEI.

### Slime Islands

Slime Islands are high up in the air and come in 3 flavors: Green, Blue, and lastly Orange in the Nether.

If you think you'll get into bows then be sure to take shears when you go up to take the leaves for fletchings. Fast leaf decay is going to be a bit annoying so you’ll need to be quick about getting the leaves. Take any saplings and some slimy dirt to plant it on. If playing on a server always replant one for the next guy.

Take some slime blocks as they are useful for tools, especially the blue slime.

The nice thing about slime is that you can make great parts from the slime crystals (balls+dirt+sand and bake) that only need the Tool Station to make, not the smeltery.

### Knight Slime

Once you have a smeltery and access to a purple slime island find the purple slime cubes and balls. Smelt with Iron and cobble. This material has very high durability and has the coveted Unnatural modifier(see below).

### Great tools

#### Pickaxes

Modifiers to care about

* Unnatural (Knight Slime):  Having a mining level beyond what's needed increases your mining speed

* Magnetic(Iron): Broken blocks are attracted to you. Fewer blocks wasted in lava, or along the sides of shafts

* Momentum(Cobalt): The longer you use the tool w/o stopping the faster it goes.

* Petramour(Ardite): Repairs itself from mining cobble

Pickaxes to build

* Mid-game pickaxe: Knight Slime handle, Iron head, Slime binding with obsidian sharpening kit.

* Late game pickaxe

    * Pre-water temple: Iron Binding, Cobalt head, Ardite handle; Modifiers: Nether star (soul bound), Diamond (durability and speed), Lapis (fortune 3), and Redstone (speed 1)

    * Post-water temple: Sponge handle (Silk touch, 1.2x durability), Prismarine Binding, Cobalt head; Modifiers: Nether Star(soul bound), Emerald(durability multiplier), Redstone (haste 2)

#### Hammers

Modifiers to care about

Width++: Mines a 5x3 rather than a 3x3.

See pickaxes for other modifiers that matter for hammers

* Mid-game hammer: 

    * Non-slime island: Bone head, Bone Handle, Bone faceplate, Stone faceplate (top slot) for easy repairs

    * Slime island access: Blue slime handle, Green slime head and faceplates. 3k durability

        * Use either stone or obsidian + flint to fix up the mining level.

* Late game hammer: Ardite handle, Cobalt Head and faceplates; Modifiers: Redstone (haste 2), Width++

    * Optionally replace the top faceplate with Iron to trade a bit of speed for magnetism and easier repairs.

#### Shurikens

Shurikens have low range, medium damage, but importantly have high rate of fire and lots of modifiers we can apply early on. It requires the Tool Forge, so must wait till you have 4 Iron blocks. It is easier on inventory and resupplying, as the material needed to repair is only needs to match the upper left material. Netherrack is a common material used to get levels out of it.

* Mid-game shuriken: Nether

* Late game shuriken

#### Bows

Bows come in 3 flavors: Short bow (available on day 1), Longbows and Crossbows, both of which require the Tool Forge. Short bow is the fastest rate of fire, Longbows maximize damage, and crossbows maximize accuracy. As with most tools redstone boosts the speed. Note Effects of bow material don't bestow on ammunition, so optimize for speed on the bow, and effects for the arrow. 

The damage to look out for on bow materials is the "bonus damage" rather than the base damage.

* Mid-game bow: Magma limbs short bow

* Mid-game arrow/bolt: Steel head, bone shaft, feather fletchings

* Late game bow: Electrum limb Longbow, cobalt plate with max redstone

* Mid-game arrow/bolt: End-rod shaft, Manyulin head, Purple slime fletchings

#### Swords

Modifiers to care about

Splintering: The more you hit, the harder you hit, up to a point.

Crude II: +10% damage vs. unarmored targets

Sacred(Bake rotten flesh+dirt+bonemeal): Nearly doubles damage vs. undead

* Early-game Mattock: Flint axe head, bone shovel head, bone handle

    * Repairs with material from either head. Works as axe and shovel also. More damage than diamond sword

* Late game Broadsword: Bone handle, Manyulyn wide guard and blade; Modifiers: Max Quartz (damage)

    * Optionally use Necrotic Bone for life steal, and Lapis for fortune (good when fighting wither skeletons.

## Mining time: I has a bucket

## ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_22.png)

Before heading out take 

* 3+ stone drums[Extra Utilties 2] (for lava)

* 10+ wood (for torches)

* Food

* **Empty Sack of Holding[Cyclic] holding a Crate[Actually Additions] for having nigh infinite slots**

What ores should I focus on? What level should I mine?

* Open Jei, Search for the ore, and open the World gen tab to see its spawn level.

* Quartz[Embers] > black quartz[Actually Additions] >Certus Quartz[Applied Energistics 2]

* Iron > Tin > Lead > Aluminium > Copper > Osmium

* Obviously grab all the Redstone, Gold, Diamonds, Emeralds you can find

Light: Tiny torches[Actually Additions] or stone sticks[Tinkers]

* If you have lots of wood, split your coal into 8 tiny coal and make tiny torches

* If you don't then turn cobble into cobble sticks-> stone torches

Bucket

* Make slime sling with the Rice dough you brought.

* Fill up drums with lava

Mining Dimension[Aroma1997's Dimensional world] 

The Mining Dimension is accessed like the Nether, through a portal you create with the Mining Tool. This tool is usually one of the first things I create with my first Iron. 

1. Head on the top of a hill otherwise the portal in the Mining Dimension will end up underground

2. Cook some Cobble into 12 stone

3. Craft the stone into Stone Bricks

4. Craft a stone pickaxe (you can't use your dirty old used one), Flint and Steel, and 2 Stone Bricks to get the Mining Tool.

5. Craft your remaining Stone bricks with the Tool to make Portal Frames

6. Build a portal with the frames and use the Mining Tool on them as if it was flint and steel.

7. Step into the portal **and Sneak**

I often have my first base in this world. A word of wisdom if choosing this path. Place your bed in the overworld near the portal. Just like trying to sleep in the Nether results in an explosion, so does it here. You might want to light up around your bed for the few moments you come to sleep. Lighting up your main base in the Mining Dimension is also easier due to how flat it is. It also doesn't rain here.

Finding Lava pools and cave entrances in the Mining Dimension are much easier. A big change seems to be that the Mining Dimension is topped with Grass rather than stone, and doesn't seem to spawn cows, only sheep. See Tinker’s Drying Racks to get leather from cooked Lamb.

Miners backpack[Forestry]

These backpacks are fairly cheap (2 iron + 4 string + 2 wool) and only need to be in your inventory to vacuum up drops.

Holds both the ore and ingot form of items it holds

* Apatite

* Gold

* Iron

* Lead

* Silver

* Tin

* Coal

* Diamond

* Emerald

## Must go deeper

## ![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_23.png)

A Tinkers construct smeltery is a fast an easy way to get obsidian w/o getting diamonds first. You can make them as small as a 3x3, leaving only 1 block for smelting. Even at this small we can make Obsidian. If you're low on Grout then use a seared window(5 glass + 4 seared bricks) instead of a Seared Tank(1 glass + 8 seared bricks).

Obsidian

Instead of making a diamond pickaxe, put water and lava into the smeltery drain with a bucket. They combine to form Obsidian. Pour out 25 blocks

Sharpening kit: An Obsidian sharpening kit upgrades the mining level of Tinkers Construct tools to Cobalt, the highest. That's what we’re about to go get.

Aiot[Actually Additions] upgrade: An obsidian AIOT will serve long as your non-mining tool (Same damage as diamond sword)

### Nether portal

Use 10 obsidian above to make a portal. If you didn't make a smeltry but have lava then fall back to making a case

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_24.png)

### Armor Up: Chestplate

The nether is more dangerous than you're used to. Ghouls, blazes outside fortresses, highly explosive creepers. Prepare with some armor. Here are some good materials to use for a chestplate. Be sure to take your slime boots, slimesling and hang glider if you have one.

* Lapis Lazuli[MekanismTools](5)

* Osmium[Mekanism](5)

* Iron (6)

* Black Quartz[ActuallyAdditions](6)

* Boron[Nuclearcraft](7)

* Diamond(8)

* Refined Obsidian[Mekanism](12)

Things to Collect

Get nether quartz, Cobalt![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_25.png), 5 ardite![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_26.png), and a handful of magma blocks.

## My first Ender pearl

Lots of mods gate mid-tier machines on ender pearls. We'll be able to make spawners later on, but bootstrapping into it all is a pain.

* Be sure to have a hang glider and slime boots

* Find either Plains or Desert during the night, look at an enderman to drag him to a relatively clear area, then drop down and duke it out.

# Machine tier

*Note to veterans of Modded Minecraft from 1.7.10: most mods have been ported to 1.12, some key ones are still behind. Those will be listed below under a translation section*

Start by building an Induction Smelter. It will double your ores, open up key alloys, has the most recipes for joining base materials together, and runs off of most power supplies.

Next We'll want a way to run power cables around, which is best done with Basic Universal Cables. Creating and upgrading these cables requires a fair bit of the Mekanism mod. See Mekanism Setup below. Following this path you also get a good Pulverizer also.

## Tips on getting common components

### Metal Alloys

Not every machine that can mix metals has the recipes for all alloys, so you'll often find you need 2 or 3 to make mod-specific alloys you need. But we can order them as to which you’re likely to get first and second.

* Smeltery[Tinker's Construct]

    * Pros: Common to have one built as part of your first base. Can melt lots of ores in parallel.

    * Cons: Doesn't get all alloys. Very easy to get unintended alloys when mixing molten metals. Pouring out metal into blocks is slow.

* Metallurgic Infuser[Mekanism]

    * Pros: Combined with a Enrichment Chamber you can make the Coal 8x as effective

    * Cons: Only alloy this makes is Bronze and Steel. Iron needs 2 passes to make Steel blend, which further needs to be smelted in Smeltery.

* Induction Smelter[Thermal Expansion]

    * Pros: Has the Most recipes for combining things for alloying, making it more friendly for other builds. Doubles ores, and can even tripple them with certain catalysts (Nickel Ore + Cinnabar -> 3 Nickel+Platinum)

    * Cons: Takes 2 invar ingots to create, nickel is a bit rare

* Alloy Furnace[NuclearCraft 2]

    * Pros: Makes all the important alloys you'd need

    * Cons: Requires Graphite to make. Harder to bootstrap into.

* Blast Furnace[IndustrialCraft2]

    * Pros: Only takes Iron and Copper to create, can turn iron directly into steel

    * Cons: Needs EU. Takes lots of iron to create. Only function is to make steel.

### Circuit chip, which is easiest

Most mod packs treat certain chips as equal. Which one to build comes down to preference. Do you want to frontload the investment in more machines to make the chips less expensive, or do you want to skip teching into a mod you're not really into.

#### Low entry, medium cost per chip

Carpenter[Forestry] block is built from x bronze and a little water and power to turn

* 1 tin + 6 redstone -> Basic circuit board[Forestry]

* Basic Circuit Board + 4 redstone + 2 glowstone + 2 lapis -> Advanced Circuit[IndustrialCraft2]

#### High Entry to get low cost per chip, Opens doors to fast automation

Mekanism is the most efficient when it comes to creating chips and steel, but takes an Enrichment Chamber to get there. Ie. invest in grinding steel early on returns cheaper chips and steel.

* redstone + Osmium -> basic control circuit

    * With Enrichment Chamber: 1 redstone + 8 osmium -> 8 basic control circuit

* 1 basic + 2 Enriched Alloy (1 iron+1 redstone) -> Advanced Control Circuit

#### No machines and no power, high cost per chip

IndustrialCraft2 only needs an ample supply of rubber

* Tools Needed: Forge Hammer(5 iron), Cutter(5 iron)

* 2 redstone + Iron + 6 plastic + 3 copper->Electronic Circuit

* Electronic Circuit + 4 redstone + 2 glowstone + 2 lapis -> Advanced Circuit[IndustrialCraft2]

### Plastic [Industrial Foregoing]

Quite a few mods are relying on plastic, which is a bit of a pain to get. Rubber trees have Latex liquid which must be extracted with a Tree Fluid Extractor. This Latex must be piped into a Latex Processing unit and joined with water to make Tiny Dry Rubber. 9 of those make Dry rubber which smelts into plastic. Normally a Tree Fluid Extractor would eventually break the rubber block, but we can work around that by breaking and replacing it periodically.

1. Craft a Sink[Cooking For Blockheads] to make an infinite water supply

2. Craft 64 Transfer Pipes[Extra Utilities 2] (they come in packs of 64)

3. Craft 4 Transfer Nodes (Liquid)[Extra Utilities 2] (they come in packs of 4)

4. Craft 4 Transfer Nodes (Items)

5. Place the Latex Processing unit down

6. 1 block away place the Tree Fluid Extractor

7. Attach the Fluid Transfer Node on the Extractor, another one on the Sink

8. Shift right click the Transfer Pipe to send their output liquid into the Latex Processing Unit

9. Power the Processor and place your Rubber Wood to confirm latex and water are being piped to the Processor.

10. Remove the Rubber wood before it breaks entirely (Normally takes like 5 minutes so no sweat).

11. Place a dispenser such that it would place[Quark] the Rubber Wood down.

    1. If you don't have Quark find an appropriate block placer machine.

12. Place an Auto-Breaker[Actually Additions] on another side of the wood

    2. Only needs redstone to break blocks, no RF power :)

    3. Use a redstone torch to toggle it to break blocks on a low redstone signal

13. Use an Transfer Node (Items) to pipe what it broke into the Dispenser

14. Place a Redstone Clock[Cyclic] to emit a very long high redstone signal followed by a short 0 redstone signal

    4. The high signal will cause the Dispenser to attempt placing the block.

    5. The low signal triggers the Auto-Breaker.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_27.png)![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_28.png)

### Metal plates

The Forge Hammer[IndustrialCraft2] can flatten a single metal ingot into its plate form, all in the crafting grid.

### Pulverized ores

Pulverizing ores often produces 2 dusts of that ore, each can make an ingot. Unlike the Smeltery, pulverizing keeps ores from inadvertently joining into alloys without explicitly combining them.

Alloys that can be combined with crafting dust together:

* 3 Copper dust + 1 Tin Dust -> Bronze Blend

* Gold + Silver -> Electrum Blend

* 2 Iron + Nickel -> Invar Blend

#### Grindstone[Applied Energistics 2]

This is an easy machine to make, requiring only certus quartz, 3 stone, and an aluminum gear. Normally you need to attach a Crank and wind it to grind ores and ingots into dust. 

#### Enrichment Chamber[Mekanism]

This machine needs 4 steel and 2 basic circuits and is the 2nd machine down the Mekanism tech tree. The upgrades for parallelism and speed are fairly cheap.

#### Pulverizer[Thermal Expansion]

The benefit with the Pulverizer is that it doesn't require any prerequisite machines. As a Thermal Expansion block it can pull and push its input and output items on any side

#### Crusher[Actually Additions]

Requires the Atomic Reconstructor, and thus power, to build.

### Steel

Getting steel is done in 2 parts. Getting either Smelting Steel dust via Mekanism (see Mekanism Setup below) or through Graphite/Coal Coke and then combining those in some alloying machine.

#### Graphite

Create a Manufactory (4 lead, 16 copper, 9 iron). This machine can turn Coal/Charcoal into Graphite Dust

#### Coal Coke

Coal Coke[Immersive Engineering] is the product of using Coal in a [Coke Oven](https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Coke_Oven_(Immersive_Engineering)). 

 It must be arranged in a 3x3x3 solid cube to work. After it is arranged in that pattern, the player must right-click one of the center blocks with an [Engineer's Hammer](https://ftb.gamepedia.com/Engineer%27s_Hammer), then the multi-block is complete. Input the Coal and a very long time later you get Coal Coke.

#### Alloying machines

While some alloys can be made in the Tinker's Smeltery, others require an alloying machine. Here is a list of those that can make steel.

* Alloy Furnace[NuclearCraft]: Takes both Coal Coke or Graphite Dust 

* Industrial Blast Furnace[Tech Reborn]: Does not take Coal Coke

* Blast Furnace[Immersive Engineering]: Requires Blaze rods and Nether bricks to make this multiblock structure

## Makanism Setup

Makanism has Circuits, Ore doubling, Universal power cables, Parallel processing, and can do it all efficiently. You can also make cool upgrades like increased speed, reduced power consumption, 

Osmium belongs to this mod, but only smelt as much as you immediately need. The ore is useful later on.

1. Bootstrap some kind of power supply (see below)

2. Make a Metalurgic Infuser (4 iron, 2 redstone, 1 osmium)

3. Infuse 4 redstone + 4 osmium -> 2 Basic Control Circuit

4. Upgrade Infuser by crafting it with Control Circuits + Iron + redstone -> Basic Infusing Factory(does 3 items)

5. Make 2 more Basic Control Circuits

6. Infuse Iron + 4 coal -> 4 Enriched Iron + 4 coal -> 4 Steel Blend

7. Smelt Steel Blend in Smeltery -> 4 steel

8. Steel + osmium + redstone + iron -> Enrichment Chamber + Circuits + redstone + iron -> Basic Enriching Factory (does 3 items)

    1. This Enrichment Chamber acts like a pulverizer

9. Enrich a handful of Coal, Redstone

10. Now 1 coal enriched into Compressed Carbon can enrich 8 iron instead of 1. Same for Redstone.

11. Create a handful of Enriched Alloy (enrich compressed redstone into iron)

12. Enrich the Osmium Ore (not ingots which require a crusher) into osmium dust

13. Combine the osmium dust, Enriched Alloys and glass into speed upgrades.

    2. Replace the Osmium dust with gold dust for energy upgrades.

## Power

### General Power tips and tricks

#### Measuring RF

RFTools has a Network Monitor that has a checkbox to see RF/t going in/out of things on most power networks.

#### Converting EU to RF

IndustrialCraft2 still runs off of EU, a legacy power system requiring special power cables to convert from RF.

Mekanism has Basic Universal Cable which can convert, but requires steel. See above for your prefered path to getting steel.

#### Bootstrapping generator

To bootstrap your first set of machines that help you build your first power supplier you probably want something that runs off of coal or wood and isn't too expensive. The question boils down to efficient or high rating.

* Survival Generator[?] creates X RF at 5 RF/t

* Coal Generator[?] creates 36000 RF at X RF/t

## Atomic Reconstructor

Black quartz: Villages and Grindstone

# Quarry time

You are going to have 1-2 main options for most mod packs. The Builder[?] with a Quarry card and the Digital Miner, both of which now take a Vertical Miner from Actually Additions.

## Builder[RFTools]

The Builder takes cards that program the builder. The card we want is the Quarry card. There are 2 ways to define what to quarry. 1) Specifying the 2 corners of a cube, 2) Typing in the dimensions and offset from the builder. Option 2 is better for quarrying large quantities deep in the earth.

After inserting the card and providing power the Builder spits out anything not voided below itself. A small or medium crate will do fine, although an ender chest makes the Mining Dimension easier.

### Teching to Builder Quarry

See [Black Quartz](#heading=h.v5c222qmu2zd) for a walkthrough on obtaining a Vertical Digger

### Using the Quarry card

Option 1: Right click the Quarry Card and match the numbers below. You'll have to change middle offset (y axis) to instruct the builder to quarry a number of blocks below it. If you’re in the mining dimension you’re feet will be at y=100. Thus if you want to access y=10 you’ll want to set the offset to -90. If your builder is higher up then you’ll be 1 off.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_30.png)

Option 2: Shift right click the card on the Builder to establish the origin. Right click on opposite ends of a cube. Then insert the card into the Builder. This method is useful for becoming familiar with the Dimensions and offsets above.

### Filtering

Filter Module[RFTools] allows you to filter for just the stuff you want, or filter out items that the Quarry card doesn't have built in. Use the module and apply the block(s) you want to search for, then toggle the whitelist/blacklist button.

Note: To get Diamonds you sneak right click with the filter on a diamond ore block in the world to add it to the filter.  Either that or make a Combiner[Mekanism] to combine diamond dust and Cobble into the ore, then use that in the filter.

![image alt text]({{ site.url }}/public/BMbpD6rCZ1qoniF20u7H2A_img_31.png)

## Digital Miner

The Digital Miner lets you create filters for ores, and pay for mining just those items. The range is limited to 100 blocks, so you may want to have wireless power and storage if you plan on mining lots from this machine

### Teching to Digital Miner

See [Black Quartz](#heading=h.v5c222qmu2zd) for a walkthrough on obtaining a Vertical Digger

See [Mekanism](#heading=h.edro78d0i5ia) to get required machines.

1. Infuse Diamond dust onto Enriched Alloy

2. Make an Osmium Compressor and a handful of Refined Obsidian Ingot

    1. Go ahead and make a Obsidian Chestplate (Armor 12 vs Diamond's 8)

3. Craft a Robbit and 2 Logistical Sorters

4. Lastly 4 atomic Alloys + 2 diamonds -> Teleportation Cores

5. Make your Digital Miner

6. It requires too much power initially so you'll want to put in 5-6 energy upgrades.

    2. These energy upgrades are multiplicative so the latter ones will have the greatest impact.

### Using the Digital Miner

[Watch this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jWJNhrV4c8k)

Filtering for ores: ores*

## Void Miner

Certain ores are only available with through physical mining or with the Void Miner. Many mods set up their gateways on these items forcing you to have teched up to a sufficiently high power level, and void miner level. 

### Items uniquely available to void and physical mining

All Tiers: Prosperity and Inferium ore

Tier 1: Litherite

Tier 2: Erodium

Tier 3: Kyronite

Tier 4: Pladium

Tier 5: Ionite

Tier 6: Aethium

# ME System

There are 4 main ways that people handle their massive storage needs

1. [Storage Drawers] + External Storage[Refined Storage]/Storage Bus[Applied Energistics 2] + crafting terminal

    1. Pros: Cheap to expand and build, Low power consumption, accessible when power goes down

    2. Cons: Visual glitches when you get really big, No automation from true ME system

2. [RFTools] storage

    3. Pros: Can be attached to existing chest layout, Cheap but finite wireless storage

    4. Cons: Buffered retrieval and UI takes some getting used to

3. [Refined Storage]

    5. Pros: no need to hunt presses

    6. Cons: As expensive as an ME system normally is

4. [Applied Energistics]

    7. Pros: Tried and trusted. You only need Skystone to craft all your presses.

    8. Cons: Meteors are still a pain to find and mine.

## Storage Drawers

Storage Drawers can hold 1-4 items with 32 stacks max per block. When chained to a Drawer Controller all of their inventories can be used, but sadly not by a Crafting Station. Native use cases are right clicking on the controller sucks items that are already in drawers out of your inventory. But with a crafting terminal and External Storage we get access to all the items. Expanding storage means building out the drawers, often covering up existing faces. We need to provide a trickle of power to an energy acceptor on the ME network. The drawer controller has a max radius of 16 blocks; but you'll hit rendering issues long before reading this limit. Covering up helps.

The big pro here is that you don't have to invest into massive inscriber speed and materials for storage chips. You just need to get your feet wet into Refined Storage and you’re done.

For storing massive quantities of items this solution can handle anything that can be compressed (cobblestone, metal ingots, redstone, lapis…) using the Compressing drawer. Sadly non-compressible items need to go into a line of jabba barrels[JABBA] or Crates[Actually Additions].

I think a wireless terminal would work, though I haven't tested it out yet.

## RFTools storage

There are 2 main independent paths that Remote Module storage works.

**Wireless Crafting Tablet**

RFTools uses tiered Storage Modules to store items, Tier 1 holds up to 100 stacks of items, Tier 2 holds 200, Tier 3 holds 300. The Storage modules don't cost much, nor to upgrade (Tier 3 takes 2 blocks of gold). The real cost is the Emerald needed to make the Storage Tablet. This tablet gives you access to the Storage Modules on the go, only needing to be recharged based on how much it is used. Without this portable tablet the modules must be installed in a Remote/Storage Module which ties you down. If you do go this route and are unhappy with the UI, you can place a Crafting Station next to it to get a simpler UI.  Sadly you’ll have to get used to this UI when using the tablet.

See the Power section for charging the tablet up.

**Storage Scanner**

The storage scanner indexes anything nearby that has an inventory. You can configure the radius. 

Watch [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TVgbo1-gCEg) on a tutorial on how to use it.

The primary benefit here is that you can leave your organized chests in place, configure priorities and routes, and expand it with more chests.

## Refined Storage

Does anyone want to fill in this section for recommended ways of bootstrapping an ME system?

## Applied Energistics

The progression and ability is the same as in Refined Storage only you use AE specific items and presses for base items.

Unlike in 1.7.10 you can create presses by using a Metallurgic Infuser [Mekanism] to infuse redstone into Skystone Dust. From there you can craft the rest with more dust.

# Mob grinding tips

### Poor Man's mob grinder

The Fan[?] is an easy way to push mobs down a long drop. They only require a lever to power. Hoppers collect drops just as well as they did before. Filtering is much easier than vanilla. Creating a large platform is easy with Builder Wands.

### Mid-game mob grinder

While spelunking you'll encounter spawners. Placing a torch on top will prevent it from working. You can take the spawner with a cardboard box[Mekanism]. To make one you’ll need one of the following based on the tech you’ve built up

* Carpenter[Forestry]

* Precision Sawmill[Mekanism]

* Sawmill[Tech Reborn]

* Sawmill[Thermal Expansion]

A mob grinding room should be X by Y big so that spawns don't appear outside the room.

Get a Mob Crusher[Industrial Foregoing] as it is the cheapest of all the grinder options.

If you want more safety keeping up your grinder you can upgrade the spawners to Resturbed[Extra Utilities 2], which disable them with a redstone signal.

Often mobs will drop damaged weapons and odd items. The Reinforced Servo[Thermal Dynamics] allows easy whitelisting items and ignoring the damage data. Pipe these crappy items into a trash can, leaving the rest for you to reap later.

If you want to see into your grinder get Dark Glass[Extra Utilities 2] to let you see through, but not letting light in.
